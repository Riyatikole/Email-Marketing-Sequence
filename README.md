# Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that utilizes React Flow for visualizing flowcharts or diagrams.

# Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed on your machine
2. MongoDB installed locally or accessible remotely
3. Basic understanding of MERN stack and React Flow

# Installation
Clone the Repository: Clone the MERN app repository from GitHub or your preferred version control system.
git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to Project Directory: Move into the project directory.
cd server 

Install Dependencies: Install server-side and client-side dependencies.
npm install
cd client
npm install

MongoDB Configuration: Ensure that MongoDB is running and accessible. Update the MONGODB_URI variable in the .env file with the appropriate MongoDB connection string.

# Running the Application
Start the Server: Run the Node.js server.
cd server
npm start

Start the Client: Open a new terminal window, navigate to the client directory, and start the React development server.
cd client
npm start

Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the MERN app with React Flow.

# Usage
Creating Flowcharts: Use the React Flow components and functionalities within the application to create, edit, and visualize flowcharts or diagrams.
Saving Data: Implement backend logic to save flowchart data to the MongoDB database.
Exporting/Importing Flowcharts: Implement functionalities to export/import flowchart data in JSON format for sharing or persistence.

# Troubleshooting
Port Already in Use: If the specified port is already in use, update the PORT variable in the .env file to a different port number.
MongoDB Connection Issues: Ensure that MongoDB is running and accessible with the correct connection string specified in the .env file.
Client Build Errors: If encountering errors related to client build, check for any missing dependencies or misconfigurations in the client-side code.

Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully set up and run the MERN application with React Flow. Start exploring the functionalities and customization options provided by React Flow to build powerful flowchart-based applications.
